# Aggregation
Export/import Data C#
C# program reading through a big dataset, doing some very basic aggregation, and write the result (and any error) to a file. The output must be a single CSV file containing the number of datapoints greater than 2.5 global_active_power, and the sum of consumed global_reactive_power for these datapoints. All of the measures should be done and ordered by month-by-month ascending
In addition, any parsing errors encountered must be logged in a text file, and each log line mention the data file and record index on which the error occurred.
